# ðŸš€ PROJECT DEVELOPMENT RECOMMENDATIONS

âœ… Add unit tests and integration tests for backend and frontend

âœ… Implement static code analysis:

- flake8 or pylint for Python
- eslint for Node.js

âœ… Use multi-stage Docker builds to reduce the size of images

âœ… Set up deployment to a server or cloud (e.g. Render, Railway, Kubernetes, AWS)

âœ… Add HTTPS and automatic SSL certificates using Let's Encrypt ([https://letsencrypt.org/](https://letsencrypt.org/))

âœ… Store secrets and configurations via .env files, GitHub Secrets, Docker Compose env_file

âœ… Add Healthchecks to docker-compose for backend and frontend to make sure that services are fully operational before nginx is launched

âœ… Use a production-ready WSGI server, such as Gunicorn, instead of the built-in Flask server to improve performance and stability
